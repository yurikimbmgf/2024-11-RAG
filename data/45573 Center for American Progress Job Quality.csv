2024-10-08,"4 Lessons on Creating Good Manufacturing Jobs Through the Biden-Harris Administration’s Industrial Investments
","This Center for American Progress article says that ""the Biden-Harris administration’s signature industrial policy program—the first in decades in the United States—offers essential lessons on how the government can directly and indirectly create high-quality jobs in manufacturing. Large investments in building out domestic manufacturing capacity, critical infrastructure investments that use American materials and products, targeted tariffs, and worker-centered trade policies can spur even larger private investments in manufacturing and create thousands of manufacturing jobs. Policymakers have made progress in the use of job quality incentives to improve the likelihood that these jobs are high quality but should also pursue enforceable minimum standards and encourage partnerships with unions that create pipelines for workers to gain skills and connect with jobs that pay good wages. Already, the scope of public and private investments from the IIJA, CHIPS, and the IRA has exceeded the scale of any federal investment in manufacturing in decades. By strengthening and expanding the reach of the manufacturing job quality policies of the IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA, advocates can ensure that the American manufacturing sector is an engine of middle-class growth.""
